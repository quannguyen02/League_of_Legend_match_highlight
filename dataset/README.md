# Notes


To fetch RIOT data, run fetching_timeline

- Generate your own API key. Be careful of the expired time

- Create a folder matches_<number> to save your fetch data. Edit the code to save them correctly
    
- Zip the folder when done and send it to me (Minh)

- Look at .gitignore before commit


To generate CSV file, which I think we should run after all data is fetched, run generate_dataset

- Change the output file name to avoid conflicts. Please look carefully guys.
